## generics
- generic types cannot be primitives
    - you have to use the wrapper classes Java provides (`Integer` instead of `int`, etc.)
    - this is called "boxing", putting a primitive into a value type
    - unboxing is where you convert a value type into a primitive
- `Collection`
    - it's an interface that extends `Iterable`
    - various data structures inherit `Collection`
    - its generic, so when you instantiate a collection you have to provide a type
    - collections don't guarantee order
- `List`
    - lists maintain order
