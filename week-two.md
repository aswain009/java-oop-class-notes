### implicit and explicit object conversion


### abstract and concrete classes and methods


###  final, public, protected, and private


### equals and toString methods for base, derived, and composed classes


### open-closed, interface segregation, and dependency inversion principles (SOLID)
- open-closed
    - a system can be extended but should not be modified
    - e.g., you can add a subclass but you can't (or don't have to) change the superclass
    - the superclass is generic enough that you can build off of it without changing it
- interface segregation
    - it's better to have a lot of small interfaces rather than one big one, so split classes up as much as possible
- dependency inversion
    - the coupling between two classes should be as low as possible, one class doesn't have to know about or bother with the implementation of another class it's using

### access modifiers
