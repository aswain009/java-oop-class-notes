## queues
- queues are FIFO structures (first in, first out)
- they're an array of elements where you can only add to the end and remove from the beginning
- examples of real-world queues include people waiting in a checkout line
- queues are most often used in scheduling algorithms
    - particularly in scheduling algorithms that deal with Poisson-distributed events
- methods that queues (should) implement
    - `bool queue(E data)` adds `data` to the end of the array
    - `E enqueue()` removes and returns the first element in the array
    - `E peek()` returns the first element in the array without removing it
    - `bool isEmpty()` tells whether the array has any elements in it (obviously)
- `LinkedLists` are the best structure to use to implement queues
    - it's fast to add to the end of them
    - and fast to remove from the beginning
    - because of the head and tail nodes
    - `ArrayLists` are only fast to remove/add to the end (O(1))
        - any operation at the beginning of an `ArrayList` will be an O(n) operation
