## decorator pattern
- a decorator class implements some interface
    - it _is a_ [insert interface name here]
- BUT it also _has an_ instance of that interface (well, a concrete subclass of that interface)
- if you create a concrete implementation of this decorator class...
    - instances of this concrete class are _immutable_ instances [insert interface name here]
