## Compare and contrast iterative versus sequential software lifecycle approaches.
- steps of SDLC, waterfall style
    - requirements analysis: what should the product do?
    - design
        - what are the business rules?
        - user stories are written at this point
    - development
        - what technologies will it use?
        - what software design patterns?
        - actual coding!
    - testing
        - unit testing
        - integration testing (how all the modules work together)
        - user testing (how long does it take user to complete tasks?)
        - regression testing
            - white box testing: testing the code while knowing about the code and how it works (unit testing)
            - black box testing: testing the code as a user would use it, not knowing about how the code is working
    - production
    - maintenance
        - change requests
        - bug reports
        - software spends most of its time here

## Use CRC cards to capture the responsibilities of each class and the relationships between classes.


## Use UML class diagrams to illustrate relationships between classes.


## Use primitive operation counts and deductive reasoning to determine the efficiency of algorithms.


## Given a set of initial conditions, predict how the runtime of an algorithm is affected by increased input size
