## List the common operations and properties of all lists as distinct from collections.
- lists
    - ordered
    - operations happen at a particular index
    - grow/shrink to accommodate add/remove actions
    - `List<T>` extends `Collection<T>` and `Iterable<T>`
- collections
    - unordered
    - have size limits
    - can be equal to each other even if the order of the elements is different
    - `Collection<T>` extends `Iterable<T>`

## Extend the AbstractCollection implementation into AbstractList and ArrayList implementations and justify design decisions.


## Analyze the ArrayList implementation to determine algorithmic efficiency.


## Use an ArrayList data structure to solve a problem.
