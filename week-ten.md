## infix and postfix
- infix notation
    - e.g. 3 + 7 * 2 - 8 / (6 - 2)
    - it's easy for humans to perform because we jump back and forth and easily follow order of opperations
    - but computers don't have the same top-down view of the problem like we do
- postfix notation
    - e.g. 3 7 2 * + 8 6 2 - / -
    - this is easy for a computer to calculate
    - a computer simply goes through the characters/numbers one at a time
    - it doesn't have to have a top-down view of the problem or jump around to figure out the order in which opperations have to be done
