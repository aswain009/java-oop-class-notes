## Recognize and apply the Template Method design pattern to solve a given problem.
- you have a fixed algorithm that does different things for different types
- a method takes objects of any class that implements some interface and calls a method defined in that interface
- that method calls a different version of the interface method depending on the specific subclass/type of the object being passed in

## Explain how interfaces reduce coupling while increasing code reuse.


## Write generic algorithms that use polymorphism to act on covariant data types.


## Explain what design patterns are and how they are used.
- design patterns are "common solutions to common problems"
- they're tried-and-true ways to organize classes and behaviors

## Recognize and apply the Strategy design pattern to solve a given problem.
